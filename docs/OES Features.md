OES has a wide range of tools and conveniences that allow developers, Managers and SREâ€™s to develop, 
build and deploy software faster, better with less friction. Below you can find the eight key features of OES:

1. **Automated Workflows:** Replace manual scripts with automated workflows to simplify CI/CD process. 
Setup entire CI/CD workflow in minutes, empowering developers to deploy applications through easy to 
create pipelines without scripts by allowing for pipelines to be stored as JSON files.

2. **Multi-cloud Deployment:** Automatically deploy applications on bare metal, Kubernetes, VMs, or 
public cloud platforms at scale. Native support for deploying applications to major cloud providers such 
as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

3. **Self-Deployment Strategies:** Deploy applications quickly and safely through out-of-box support for 
deployment strategies, roll back/canary, blue/green, progressive roll-out strategies to minimize risk 
during deployment.

4. **Scalable and Extensible platform:** Ensure smooth and painless enterprise-scale adoption with pre-built 
integrations  and open-source community based support.

5. **Easy lifecycle management:** Enable reliable and efficient operation wrt to maintenance and frequent
