#**Application Dashboard**#

When you log into ISD, the first thing you will see is the Application dashboard. 
The application dashboard gives you the high-level operational information you need to help you 
understand the health of all your applications at a glance. In the application dashboard, you 
can also view the environments and the gates that the service or the application passes through 
before final deployment. 

* After your successful login, the Application Dashboard appears and it gives you high-level overviews of your applications, and pipelines along with the following important operational information: 

	1.** Total Applications** - The number of applications to which you have access.	

	2.** Deployments** - The total number of deployments, from all the applications to which you have access.	

	3.** Pipeline Failures** - Any pipeline failures, in any of the applications to which you have access.

	4.** Pending Approvals** - Any approvals which are pending for your action.

	5.** Policy Violations** - Any policy violations, in any of the applications to which you have access.
 
	6.** Verification Failures** - Any failures in the verification process within the applications to which you have access.

	7.** Applications** - Names of the each application
