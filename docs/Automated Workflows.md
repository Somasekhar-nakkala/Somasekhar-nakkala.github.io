#**Automated Workflows**#
OES allows you to automate application delivery workflows with easy-to-create pipelines. OES offers 
templatized pipeline-as-code  to enhance re-usability and provide ability to insert fine-grain policy 
within the pipeline, with real-time visibility and diagnostics during the pipeline execution. 

1. **Easy pipeline creation:** DevOps engineers can simplify delivery configuration with OES pipeline-as-code, 
and manage versioning and automated updates of pipeline changes.
To know more about how to create a pipeline, - refer [here](https://docs.opsmx.com/release-history/previous-releases/isd-4.0/knowledge-base/manage-pipelines/create-a-pipeline)

2. **Manage 1000â€™s of pipeline:** You can manage continuous delivery OES pipelines with the ease of using your 
management tools such as power UI, wizards, or JSON API.

3. **Embed Policies:** OES pipelines provide flexibility to enforce static and dynamic policies so that compliance 
managers can guarantee adherence to SDLC compliance.

4. **Pipeline Visibility:** OES pipelines allow you to gain visibility from code check-in to test-automation to 
approval to production deployment through integration with JIRA, Jenkins, ServiceNow, AppDynamics, 
and other CD and APM tools.

5. **Notifications:** Connect with collaboration tools of your choice (Git, Gitlab, JIRA, Jenkins, Servicenow, Slack, Hipchat) 
right away and get notified about deployment status, policy violations etc.
