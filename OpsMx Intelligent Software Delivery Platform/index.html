<h1 id="opsmx-isd"><strong>OpsMx ISD</strong></h1>
<p>OpsMx’s ISD is designed to help release software faster, with fewer errors and with minimal human intervention to 
create a better end customer experience and free up time and Manpower for businesses to scale and Innovate.
ISD allows you to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build Flexible deployment pipelines for multiple cloud environments</li>
<li>Increase compliance and communication across your development and operations teams</li>
<li>Automate key stages of pipelines</li>
<li>Make more informed decisions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="build-flexible-deployment-pipelines-for-multiple-cloud-environments"><strong>Build Flexible deployment pipelines for multiple cloud environments:</strong></h3>
<p>Using ISD’s Orchestration Module, OpsMx builds off of Spinnaker, the premier open source multi cloud deployment solution, 
by providing users with extra layers of data and information to make better decisions. For example, Spinnaker does not 
have clear distinctions between the application and the various services and 
microservices that make up that application. ISD however allows users to easily see the various services and 
microservices that make up each application and the pipelines that make up each individual service and microservice. 
This allows you to easier see dependencies between service pipelines and as a result help you optimize your workflow. 
Whether used as an On-prem or a Managed SaaS solution, the orchestration module offers a host of other features like:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Self Service onboarding:</strong> ISD allows users to serve themselves whether it is adding a new tool, cluster or pipeline, 
ISD allows users to serve themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pipelines as code:</strong> While Spinnaker gives users visual representations of your pipelines so that you can see how your 
deployment stages might playout, ISD allows you to maintain your pipelines as JSON files which allows you to easily 
store them as, modify them and repurpose them using any Git-based repository, saving your team time and your business 
money.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure as code:</strong> As customers demand more from their CI/CD tools, the infrastructure has to be able to scale to 
meet those requirements. ISD allows you to use tools like Terraform to have your infrastructure like Servers available 
as code. This allows you to easily scale your application and, as a result, your business without having to worry as much 
about infrastructure costs.

</ol>
<h3 id="increase-compliance-and-communication-across-your-development-and-operations-teams"><strong>Increase compliance and communication across your development and operations teams:</strong></h3>
<p>Using our Pluggable data layer, ISD supports over 40+ integrations with various tools that cover each and every stage of 
software development and operation no matter your team size or work flow. It supports communication with tools like Slack, 
the Google communication suite, git based repositories like github and Bit-Bucket, automation tools like Jenkins, ticketing 
systems like Jira and so many others. By galvanizing these tools through one cohesive UI, ISD improves visibility for the entire 
team and allows each individual member to know the health of their application.</p>
<p>In addition to this, ISD offers a scalable policy enforcement system by using the Open Policy engine allowing for greater 
enforcement of organizational policies at larger scales.</p>
<h3 id="automate-key-stages-of-pipelines"><strong>Automate key stages of pipelines:</strong></h3>
<p>Integrating tools is just the beginning. Using OpsMx’s Data and Intelligence module, you can use artificial intelligence 
to make optimal decisions without relying on human intervention. For example if you are performing a log analysis, 
comparing the old version of the software and new versions of a software, the artificial intelligence will automatically 
calculate the risk of the deployment and decide whether to deploy or not all without needing a human to intervene in the 
process.</p>
<h3 id="make-more-informed-decisions"><strong>Make more informed decisions:</strong></h3>
<p>As the saying goes, “What gets measured gets managed.” ISD provides users key insights into their application health including 
data such as the fastest pipeline, the slowest pipeline, any errors encountered. This enables a more centralized and detailed view 
of your application health. In addition to this, when manual decisions are required ISD automatically gathers information from relevant 
sources so that the user making the decision does not need to look for that information and can make a faster decision. Whether you use 
Argo or another CD platform, the Data and Intelligence module AKA, Autopilot, is available stand alone.</p>
